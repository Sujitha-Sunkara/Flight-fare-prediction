## Introduction:

The number of people who travel by plane has risen dramatically in recent years. 
Prices change constantly owing to various situations, making it difficult for airlines to maintain pricing. 
As a result, we'll attempt to fix the problem via machine learning. This can assist airlines in determining what costs they can sustain. 
It can also assist clients to predictÂ flight fares and making travel plans appropriately.

## Dataset:

Kaggle was used to obtain the dataset.There are 10683 records in total, with 11 different attributes such as source, destination, airline, total stops, and duration. The fare was predicted using machine learning regression techniques.

## Exploratory Data Analysis:

In this notebook, I perform basic exploratory data analysis on the dataset in order to gain a better knowledge of it. Matplotlib and seaborn are two Python packages that are used. I talked about the following topics:
- Understanding the facts as a whole
- Visualizing the trends to analyze each of the factors and their interactions.
- With the help of existing features, I created a few new features and visualized them.

## Data Analysis:
### Univariate Analysis:

From different Univariate analysis, it been observed that 
- Jet Airways has the highest number of flights
- More flights originate from Delhi, which is followed by Kolkata and least in chennai
- The bulk of flights arrive in Cochin as their final destination.
- Most of the flights has one stop.
- more passengers travelled in the month of may followed by june. This is due to that mostly many people planned their vacations in summer.
